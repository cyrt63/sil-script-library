Scripts in this folder are intended to be invoked from the following applicable
triggers:
* Live Fields (Screen Listeners)

It is unlikely that these scripts can be used for any other trigger source.

Please note that these scripts must reside in the root _silprograms_ directory!

Also note that you can only utilize one Screen Listener script per project,
but you can listen to multiple fields and execute multiple scripts from within
that single listener script.
